# Introduction

## What is Airport?
Airport is a comprehensive internalization library made to support text translations, number, datetime, currency conversions based on the locale you set.

## Why Airport?
### Comprehensive
Airport supports most of the basic functions you need to service multiple regions.

### Translation code splitting
Airport only imports translations that are required in the current page resulting in smaller bundle size.

### GUI translation management tool
Airport comes with `LS Manager` which is a GUI translation management tool to edit translations in your source code.

Because `LS Manager` creates pull requests with modifications, all developer has to do is final confirmation and merge into the codebase. `LS Manager` also supports bulk modifications through file export.
